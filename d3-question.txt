Create a small visualization using D3.js

The data is from the attached cars.txt file
(You can pre-format it to json for input into your visualization)


The visualization should

- Render circles that represent these cars

- Each circle should have a label with in it, showing up to 5 characters of the car's name

- Circles for cars made in the USA should be colored in blue. 

- When the user hovers over the circle, the circle should get bigger and show the full name within the circle

- When the user clicks on a circle, use the javascript alert to show an alert dialog.
  All the details of the car should be shown.

  The dialog would look something like this

[ Car: Buick Estate Wagon     ]
[ Country: U.S                ]
[ MPGWeight: 16.9             ] 
   <other attributes>
[  Cylinders: 8               ]
